# Classify Basic Brain Tumors from MRIs

This brain tumor classification model is trained to recognize four different classes: glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and no-tumor. The model is based on Facebook Research's DINOv2 model, which is trained using a large public dataset and incorporates state-of-the-art image recognition. By analyzing brain images from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, the model is capable of accurately classifying brain tumor types. The training of this model was performed using a large dataset and achieved high accuracy rates. Early detection and classification of brain tumors can provide patients with better treatment options. This model could have an important application in the medical field and is designed to be used in clinical applications. This model can classify various types of brain tumors and support specialist physicians. It can produce fast and reliable results on MRI scans and help improve brain tumor diagnosis processes. Note: This model should only be used as an auxiliary tool and a specialist's assessment is required for a definitive diagnosis.
