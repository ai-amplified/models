    "## Short Description:\n",
    "The Named Entity Recognition (NER) models for medical entity extraction developed by Aimped are cutting-edge tools designed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of medical text analysis across various healthcare domains. These models leverage advanced machine learning techniques and are trained on custom datasets to meet the specific needs of healthcare professionals, researchers, and stakeholders. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the models include: \n",
    "- **Extract Posological Entities from Medical Texts:** This model specializes in identifying posological entities to improve patient report analysis.\n",
    "- **Extract Entities from Radiology Reports:** It analyzes radiology reports to identify 14 distinct entities such as procedures and imaging findings.\n",
    "- **Extract Cancer Genetics Information from Medical Texts:** This model uses BioBERT embeddings to identify 16 entities related to cancer genetics, including genes and proteins, achieving State-of-the-Art accuracy for biomedical research.\n",
    "- **Extract Clinical Entities from Medical Texts (Large):** This model identifies 60 entities, such as symptoms and vital signs, to aid in processing diagnoses and treatments. \n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these models significantly contribute to better patient care, streamlined research, and informed decision-making in the medical field.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also offer many more NER models for medical and healthcare applications designed to address specific needs within the healthcare industry, which you can explore. These include models like: \n",

The woman has hypertension treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and a diuretic to maintain blood pressure at 120/80 mm Hg. Her glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is 6.7% (normal, <5.7%). Her insulin doses are all administered through a continuous insulin infusion pump using insulin aspart. Her present weight is 60 kgÍ¾ thus, her insulin requirement was calculated as 0.6 times her weight in kilograms = 36 units daily. She reported that she would try to become pregnant next month.\""
